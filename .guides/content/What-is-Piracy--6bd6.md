When intellectual property is stolen by making a digital copy of the item and taking it without permission, it is called **piracy**. Some people download movies or music without permission and without paying for them, feeling that they aren't hurting anyone by watching or listening for free. However, every creation was made with hard work by one or more individuals. Those people deserve to be paid for their work, and piracy steals the money away from them that they have already worked for.

## A Story in Piracy

As piracy of movies became more and more common, many DVDs started featuring an anti-piracy message reminding people that stealing movies was a crime just like stealing a purse or a car. Before every movie, this anti-piracy ad was played. The ad featured edgy music with text written on the screen stating:

The message of the ad was true and valuable. However, the creators of the video did not follow their own advice, and the world soon found out that they had not gotten permission to use the music playing during the ad. In an unusual twist, the artist who created the music filed a lawsuit against the video's creators, and the anti-piracy video had to stop being used due to piracy.

Piracy is illegal for everyone. Whether the property was created by an individual or a large company and whether the person using it is one individual or a large corporation, piracy is stealing, and it is illegal.
