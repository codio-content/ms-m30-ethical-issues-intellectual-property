In some cases, resources can be used without ethical issues:


- **Creative Commons**: A Creative Commons (CC) license is one of several public copyright licenses that enable the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted work. A CC license is used when an author wants to give people the right to share, use, and build upon a work that they have created.

- **Fair Use**: In US law, the fair use doctrine says that brief excerpts of copyright material may, under certain circumstances, be quoted verbatim for purposes such as criticism, news reporting, teaching, and research, without the need for permission from or payment to the copyright holder.

- **With Permission**: When in doubt, it may be a good idea to reach out to the creator of an item and request permission to use it. If granted, keep this permission given *in writing* in case issues should arise later.
